***PyTorch Classifier with Decision Boundary***

Overview

This repository provides a simple yet effective example of how to create a classifier in PyTorch, complete with a decision boundary visualization. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the fundamental steps required to build, train, and evaluate a neural network classifier using PyTorch.

Features

Implements a basic feedforward neural network for classification.

Uses synthetic data to train the classifier.

Visualizes the decision boundary to understand model performance.

Includes customizable hyperparameters for experimentation.
